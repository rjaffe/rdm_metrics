# rdm_metrics
Scripts for cleaning, counting, displaying, etc. Research Data Managemnent program metrics

I've added my initial script, RDM_metrics_FY2015-Q2.py. It takes an argument that points at a .csv file exported from the RDM Drupal site (via a Drupal view called 'Ricks_view'). 

To run, navigate to the folder that contains the script and the csv and enter:
    python3 RDM_metrics_FY2015-Q2.py {csv file name}
